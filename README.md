# Module federation demo

This is a simple demonstration of combinating the following using module federation:
- **Layout** Vue2 + Webpack
- **Cart** Vue3 + Vite
- **Discovery** Vue3 + Webpack

All of these should in theory be capable of being a host - but not all may have been tested.
The main purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the possibility of running Vue3 applications, bundled using either Vite or Webpack, inside of a Vue2 host. 

In short: magic ðŸª„
